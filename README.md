**By Drizzle**
## What is it?
GhostFN is a program I have been developing that is able to change your skin in lobby to any skin ( or cosmetic ) that you want.

## Installation

* Click the green Code button then download zip. Extract the files to somewhere on your computer, then enter that folder.

* Download the newest version of python from [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click Add To Path when installing it.

* Download Nodejs from [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). You don't need to change anything while installing it

* Lastly run start.bat and select Install required packages.



## How to use

* Select Auth Login

* Login to your epicgames account and click Confirm

* Select Ghost Equip

* Now wait for the window to open and select any cosmetic you want

* **Note: Cosmetics can only be seen by other people in your party! Once you change any cosmetic in your locker, ready up, or emote then the ghost equip will go away and you will have to select that cosmetic again**

## Changing crown wins

* To change the number of crown wins that shows up open settings.json with nodepad and edit "numOfCrowns" to any number you want. 

* **Note: A negtive number of crown wins will make everyones levels disappear in the party and will not display that number of wins. Im pretty sure the max number of wins that will show is 9,999**
